# Image_Classification_CNN
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that classifies an image into 1 of 10 categories from the CIFAR-10 dataset

This Project utilizes the CIFAR-10 dataset to accurately classify images using a simple CNN. It achieves this by using a 
relatively simple structure by reducing the dimensionality of the tensors while incorporating maxpooling and dropout to help 
the model better generalize the data into its possible classifications. I was able to attain a 72.4% accuracty on the 
validation dataset. This project used python 3 and Tensorflow 1.0 and trainied in a GPU Instance on Floydhub.
